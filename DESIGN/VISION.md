# Western Standoff - Design Vision

## Core Philosophy
**"Every shot is chaos with intention."**

This is not just a shooter; it is a reputation-survival simulation. The gun is a tool for punctuation, but the consequences ripple through the social fabric of the game world.

## The Honor System (Social Filter)
Honor is not a high score; it is a filter that changes how the world interacts with the player.
- **Low Honor (Outlaw)**:
  - Recruitable gang members at the Cantina.
  - Bounties on your head.
  - Hunted by Sheriffs.
  - Doctor may refuse service or charge double.
- **High Honor (Lawman)**:
  - Can be deputized or become Sheriff.
  - Targeted by outlaws seeking fame.
  - Townsfolk offer discounts or free drinks.

## Combat & Collateral Damage
The random targeting system is a feature, not a bug. Missed shots have consequences:
- **Collateral Damage**: Hitting a bystander, killing a horse, or shattering a window creates debt and enemies.
- **Emergent Feuds**: The owner of a killed horse may hunt you down later.
- **Legal Trouble**: "Reckless endangerment" can lead to jail time even if you win the duel.

## The Meta-Loop: Sheriff vs. Outlaw

### The Sheriff Path
- **Enforce the Rules**: Penalize early draws.
- **Judgment**: Decide who rots in jail and who hangs.
- **Corruption**: Take bribes to look the other way.
- **Risk**: High profile target for every aspiring gunslinger.

### The Outlaw Path
- **Robberies**:
  - **Solo**: High risk, requires a horse for escape.
  - **Gang**: Recruit NPCs (requires Low Honor/Infamy).
  - **Heists**: Coach and Train robberies (requires horses for the whole crew).
- **Fugitive Life**: Flee town, start fresh with a bounty, be hunted by lawmen from previous towns.

## Progression & "No Game Over"
Death is rare; consequences are frequent.
- **Defeat**: Wake up at the Doctor's (debt) or in Jail (loss of time/items).
- **Jail**: Break out, serve time, or rot.
- **Fleeing**: Move to a new randomly generated town, but reputation follows.

## Procedural Generation
Each playthrough seeds a new world:
- **Towns**: Random names, layouts, and NPC dispositions.
- **Player**: Random starting stats and "past injuries".
- **Economy**: Variable prices and job availability.

## UI & HUD
- **Persistent HUD**: Wanted status, Town info, Gun stats, Visual sprite (injuries), Cash, Ammo, Horse status.
- **Duel Screen**: Full takeover. Tension building. Visible ammo cylinders. Range markers.
